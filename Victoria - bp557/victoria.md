Hi, my name is Victoria. I am from Beijing, China. 

I have a cat, his name is Niki, he is a three-year-old ragdoll cat

My favorite lyrics are from the song Shape of My Heart:
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
