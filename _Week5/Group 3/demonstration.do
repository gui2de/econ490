regcompare lexp gnppc popgrowth

** This summary table shows the regression comparison of life expentancy using GNP per capita and population growth as regressors. The gnppc variable is statistically significant as well as the multiple regression with population growth. The interaction term with pop. growth is also significant. This shows that gnppc and population growth of a country are separate important factors of life expentancy. 

// Use case 2
sysuse auto.dta , clear
regcompare price mpg foreign

** This summary table indicates that foreign and domestic cars do not significantly differ in price overall, but when controlling for gas mileage, foreign-made cars cost more on average. The interaction term is not significant in the fourth model, and the foreign/domestic variable is insignificant when the interaction term is included. Based on these results and the summary statistics in the table, the multiple regression model without an interaction term may be the best fit.

// Use case 3
sysuse bplong.dta, clear
regcompare bp sex agegrp

** Based on the summary table, we find that the multiple regression model without an interaction term may have the best fit for this data. The coefficients are both significant, and the R-squared values and F-statistic indicate that the multiple regression model may explain more of the variation in blood pressure levels than the other models. This model shows that sex and age are both important factors for blood pressure levels, but their interaction may not be as important.
