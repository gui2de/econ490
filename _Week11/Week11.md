# Week 11 Homework Assignment

This week, you will be working off of your previous survey and adding features to it.

## Step 1 : Update your survey with feedback and a sensitive questions module

You will update your survey (last submitted in week 7) with
- The feedback you got from your peer and/or instructor from weeks 6 and 7 on your survey
- An additional module asking sensitive questions that are relevant in the context of your survey, using one of the techniques we covered in class, like the list experiment or the unrelated question technique

## Step 2 : Test your survey form definition with [ietestform](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/Ietestform)

In your .md file, describe errors or inefficiencies that ietestform allowed you to correct for. This step effectively replaces the peer review for this assignment; your survey will be reviewed by a program, and you will reflect the lessons you learned from this review in your .MD file.

## Step 3 : Generate Stata templates and download your data

This was previously outlined as a step in week 7's assignment, but made little sense back then as you only had your own mock observation to go off off (poor assignment timing on our end!). Now that you should have a couple more observations from BÃ©atrice and Roy submitted in your form data, you can download your data, apply the Stata templates to it and browse it. If you have less than 3 mock submissions in your survey, fill it out a few times to reach at least 3 mock submissions before completing this step. The stata template will require you to have created a stata "language" for your survey for better labeling.

Once you have mock observations submitted for your survey, download your data (Export tab on surveycto), generate and run the stata template using your stata labels. Store both the dofile and the data in your folder of the class repository, and commit those changes. Note that the dta files should be ignored by the git repository, which means they will stay on your local repository but not pushed to the remote repo on github and not tracked by version control.

## Step 4 : Submit to the repository on your weekly branch

This week, you will submit
- An updated .md file including a link to your survey form definition and a description of results from ietestform
- A .csv of your downloaded data, and your stata template

No peer review required for this assignment.
