My survey seeks to explore what changes to the Washington metropolitan area's public transit systems might affect how people with personal vehicles travel. Perhaps some of these personal vehicle users do so because they are disappointed with the current system, and would drive less or even give up their vehicle if the system were improved.

Thus, I have restricted the survey to people who 
1) have a personal vehicle
2) live in D.C., Maryland, or Virginia
3) are at least 16 years old (and less than 150, to prevent typos from affecting the responses).

The first sections determine respondents' eligibility to take the survey and extract demographics information.

Then, we gather information about respondents' travel habits by asking where they travel, how often they travel there, how often they do so using their personal vehicle, and what other ways they travel to each destination.

Then, we ask how certain improvements or policy changes might affect respondents' tendency to ride the bus or rail, and whether some combination of changes could actually cause them to get rid of their vehicle.

Finally, if respondents say that improvements to the transit system might lead them to get rid of their vehicle, there is an open text box allowing them to explain what those changes would be.

** I need help designing one section of the survey. I tried many different methods, but could not figure out how to ask respondents about their travel habits BY DESTINATION.

** That is, I wanted to do a repeat group that would ask respondents the same three questions for each destination that they previously said they travel to monthly.

** My problem is that I can't figure out how to display the destination name (e.g., work), instead of something like "destination 1."
