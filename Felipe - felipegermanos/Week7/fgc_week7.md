Hi! This is a porto-political test that I began thinking about. I get very frustrated with the questions of most political tests, so I figured I'd best go ahead and try my own.

I did not think of a good scoring method yet, and the ending is still a little clunky with the repeat - I appreciate any help with that.


Here is the link to the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZEj3gfQEZJdb3DeZy2L_vhNtsNKgFKdGPw4-cNNtao8/edit?usp=sharing


And here is the link to the survey: https://gui2de.surveycto.com/collect/fgc_week6?caseid=

We have added 10 new users which are still blank slates. In the future, I would be interested in applying this survey to my friends (hopefully, after the elections in Brazil are through) and create some sort of scoring system. These users will serve as placeholders for now.
