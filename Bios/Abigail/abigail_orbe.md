My name is Abigail, and I am from Connecticut.

My favorite song is Aura by Mariah the Scientist. The lyrics of the pre-chorus/chorus are:
I can be what you need, maybe more, everything
Maybe you'll come to your senses
I'll use up my minutes
To tell you how I believe you are a rainbow
All the Heaven I need to see
You're my promise everlasting
Where you are, I hope to be
