Hi, my name is Yash. I am from India. 

My favourite tv show currently is Family Man; an Indian spy thriller! 

My favourite song currently is 'For Aisha' by Evan Giia and MEMBA. 

Lyrics: 
Hey Is this all it's gonna be? Gold dust shimmers on my feet
They laid me down and the sky turned pink.
Is this all it's gonna be?
Gold dust shimmers on my feet
They laid me down and the sky turned pink

Umraan main saariyaan ji layiyaan
Roshni main saariyaan pi layiyaan
Rangaan di kahaaniyaan chakh chakh ke
Main te haan ungliyaan chat gayiyaan
Darrta hai Raaton ka andhera
Duum daba ke voh to bhaagega jab aayega savera
Aasmaan mein Suraakh tu bana de
Uss paar hi to hai na Din ka basera

Walking on the tightrope singing in the lifeboats
Why they Wana medicate me like a (cough) sick joke
I don't wanna let go never mind chor doe
And if I get a tummy ache then I'll just take a Pepto (pink)Umraan main saariyaan ji layiyaan
Roshni main saariyaan pi layiyaan
Rangaan di kahaaniyaan chakh chakh ke
Main te Haan ungliyaan chat gayiyaanFall right out, ate a mouthful of clouds
So Don't worry about me now, don't worry about me now
We both know I've been here all along
So don't worry when I'm gone, worry when I'm goneLoriyaan suna neendein aayi
Thaki thaki main jhapki aayi
Thodi si mohlat hai
Kharcheingey hauley se

Gini chuni saansein main laayi
Socha ye tha mainey choti se
Chhaati ki gullak hai
Kharcheingey hauley seKhuli khuli aankhein yeh
Khaabon ka jharokha hai
Jaagey jaagey dekho to
Sach hongey yeh bharosa hai
Har pal ka mazaa le
Tu Dheere se dheere se
Oh ho budhu darr na
Tu jeeney se jeeney seWalking on the tightrope singing in the lifeboats
Why they Wana medicate me like a (cough) sick joke
I don't wana let go never mind chor doe
And if I get a tummy ache then I'll just take a pepto (pink)Umraan main saariyaan ji layiyaan
Roshni main saariyaan pi layiyaan
Rangaan di kahaaniyaan chakh chakh ke
Main te haan ungliyaan chat gayiyaanI just wana see you having fun
For me, for me, for me, for me
Khushi when I know you feel the love
From me, from me, from me, from meI just wana see you having fun
For me, for me, for me, for me
Khushi when I know you feel the love
From me, from me, from me, from meSaas, saas, saas, saasUmraan main saariyaan ji layiyaan
Roshni main saariyaan pi layiyaan
Rangaan di kahaaniyaan chakh chakh ke
Main te haan ungliyaan chat gayiyaan
