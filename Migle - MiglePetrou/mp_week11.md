### This version of the survey has addressed previous comments to make sure that case management works and the workflows are enforced appropriately. A sensitive question has also been added. 
#### ietestform gives me an error "worksheet settings not found"

This is part of a broader survey that aims to gauge people's perceptions of various climate change policies. The survey asks the respondents about their basic socioeconomic background (age, gender, education, etc.) and measures their political leanings through several questions related to voting behaviour, general interest in politics, leaning on economic policy issues, and interest and participation in environmental causes. An important set of questions centres around energy usage and lifestyle as related to climate change. The answers to these questions will help us to assess how respondents may personally be affected by climate policies.
