My survey is geared to collect data on the Georgetown undergraduate core curriculum. In order to complete the survey, you must be a Georgetown student.


Week 11 reflections on ietestform:

After testing my form using ietestform, the program alerted me to a few issues with my survey. Most of them seem to be related to mis-labelling or failing to label components of the formâ€” I am not sure that I fully understand how to make these changes, so I am including the report in this folder as well. The last issue is "unused choice list," but based on my understanding, I don't think that this is a critical/urgent issue, and the form should still be able to operate properly.
