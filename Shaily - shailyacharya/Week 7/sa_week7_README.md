My survey is geared to collect data on the Georgetown undergraduate core curriculum. In order to complete the survey, you must be a Georgetown student. Each observation is a different undergraduate from Georgetown, from any of the 5 schools that undergrads are enrolled in, who are affected by the core curriculum. The survey asks for information about the students' opinions on the university core curriculum, not the individual curriculums of each of the 5 schools.
