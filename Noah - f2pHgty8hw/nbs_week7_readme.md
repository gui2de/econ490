I developed a survey of Georgetown students/alumni regarding their coursework in the previous semester. Each case is a person who took a class or classes at Georgetown last semester.

Case management file: nbs_week7_case_data_set.csv

Survey spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FgDB12Hy-yQu1YJfpqSidnRJVNnUb6A4ac8CyW9zA1o/edit?usp=sharing

SurveyCTO form: https://gui2de.surveycto.com/collect/nbs_week6?caseid=nbsXX

NOTE: I generated 10 caseids, numbered 01, 02, 03, ..., 09, 10. The user must replace XX in the SurveyCTO link above with the appropriate caseid (and don't forget the leading zero).
