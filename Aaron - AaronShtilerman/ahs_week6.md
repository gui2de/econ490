##Georgetown Undergraduate Student Survey
The survey collects data on Georgetown undergraduate students, and identifies
students taking courses in mathematics or accounting.
I know by nature the survey is a little redundant, making the user list their
classes and asking them if they took specific classes, it's just for the
application of using a dataset.
