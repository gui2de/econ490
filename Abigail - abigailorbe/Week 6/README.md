The research quetion behind my survey is: Are people, specifically adults aged 27 to 37, more likely to be active in their communities if they live in the same state in which they attended primary and secondary school? The intuition behind this is that people who completed all of their education in one state may feel more connected to their community and invested in its success, leading them to be more involved in state and local government as well as community organizations. I restrict the survey to adults aged 27 to 37 because this represents the individuals who, as of 2023, will have completed high school around 10-20 years ago. These individuals are also more likely to have young children in the local school system (a few of my questions ask about involvement in school-based organzations). I also restrict the survey to respondents who completed all of their schooling in the U.S. and who graduated high school.

After the eligibility and demographic questions, I ask about the states in which the respondent attended primary and secondary school to understand how many times they moved and where. I have conceived two ways to approach these questions, and I have included both in the survey, as I'm still unsure which method I prefer. I would love your feedback on which approach you think is more efficient, more intuitive, and less cumbersome.

The second section includes questions about involvement in various levels of community engagement and the time dedicated to those activities.
