##Kenya PMT Questionnaire

This is a portion of a proxy-means testing (PMT) questionnaire awaiting deployment in Kenya. 
This portion contains questions about a household's primary dwelling-related expenses
and its overall income. The remaining portion of the questionnaire would include 
further questions about additional expenses related to the household's secondary dwelling, 
consumption of durable goods, education, healthcare, and so on. The goal of the PMT is to 
identify a household's income in contexts where the government or relevant parties 
do not have enough information about household level income. 

This survey is just the first draft and certainly needs refined. I appreciate any input 
you may have to improve the survey! Thank you for your time and inputs.
