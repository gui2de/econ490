##Kenya PMT Questionnaire

This is a portion of a proxy-means testing (PMT) questionnaire awaiting deployment in Kenya. 
This portion contains questions about a household's primary dwelling-related expenses
and its overall income in the past year. The survey is directed to the head of the household 
but it also inquires about other members of the household, specifically, those who earn. 

The remaining portion of the questionnaire would include 
further questions about additional expenses related to the household's secondary dwelling, 
consumption of durable goods, education, healthcare, and so on. The goal of the PMT is to 
identify a household's income in contexts where the government or relevant parties 
do not have enough information about household level income. 

This survey is just the first draft and certainly needs refined. I appreciate any input 
you may have to improve the survey! Thank you for your time and inputs.

##ietestform 

There were two primary issues with the survey. First, there are non numeric values in 
the [value] column of the choice sheet. Specifically, I have coded put Province_Code and
County_Code in the value column for the provinces and counties in Kenya. However, I 
remember using a similar approach in class earlier so I am not entirely sure if this 
remains an isssue. 

Second, I had field types other than 'note' which were not required. However, I went 
back to the questions and realised that it was an intentional strategy on my part and 
thus I wouldn't want to change that part.
